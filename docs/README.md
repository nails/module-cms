# Docs for `nailsapp/module-cms`
> Documentation is a WIP.


This module brings a full featured BYOFE (Bring Your Own Front End) Content Management System to Nails app.

The CMS is broken down into the following four concepts:

- [Areas](/docs/areas/README.md) - Complex areas which contain multiple configurable widgets
- [Blocks](/docs/blocks/README.md) - Single, small blocks of content
- [Menus](/docs/menus/README.md) - Fully configurable, nestable menus
- [Pages](/docs/pages/README.md) - Entire pages made up of multiple editable areas
